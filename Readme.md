## Violence Recognition

#### Recognizing violence using deep learning and image processing

+ Downloaded violence videos from youtube and split in to small size and scaled all of their resolution to 240 x 320. 
+ I have used "moviepy" to do all these video processing and then saved them in to violence and nonviolence folders.

Please look in to `Violence_detection.ipynb` file for the complete approach of preprocessing and training methods.
